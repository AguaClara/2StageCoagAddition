## Abstract


Based on the modelling result and bonding mechanism of humic acid, clay and PAC coagulant, we hypothesized that two-stage coagulant addition, namely a separate coagulant addition, would increase the particle removal efficiency. The first addition of coagulant offset the effect of humic acid in water while the second stream of coagulant aggregated clay. Using the same apparatus fabricated from last semester, we conducted experiment for both one- and two-stage coagulant addition. By comparing the particle removal efficiency of different coagulant addition methods, we aim to close the debate of one stage versus two stage.


## Introduction

Flocculation is among the most applied processes for water and wastewater treatment. Therefore, a thorough understanding of the physical and chemical process in flocculation is critical to the optimization of water treatment process, and so a predictive model to describe the flocculation process is needed. However, the model built in the past by AguaClara only considered the presence of clay and coagulant in water and failed to take natural organic matters (NOM) into consideration. NOMs are matters composed of organic compounds from the remains and waste products of organisms such as plants and animals and are ubiquitous in the natural water system. NOMs can be generated within the water source through biological activities, or introduced to the water body via drainage within watersheds, including substances produced during the breakdown of terrestrial organisms [(Hudson et al., 2007)](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/rra.1005). The application of flocculation to remove NOM from drinking water supplies is not only efficient, but also helps to avoid the formation of disinfection by products (DBPs).[(Mika et al.,2018)](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/B9780128015032000033) For processes based on the use of chemicals (e.g. coagulation and oxidation), the increasing concentrations of NOM require the use of more chemicals or materials [(Xu et al. , 2016a)](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1385894715013406?via%3Dihub). This ultimately leads to the generation of more sludge or spent chemical reagents. Hence, studying the effect of NOM on flocculation is crucial in developing flocculation processes. It can add to optimize the operating conditions, including coagulant dosage.

The original model in the past that only takes coagulant and clay into account has been extended by including the effect of NOM on flocculation in calculation. According to the bonding mechanism between clay, humic acid (HA), and coagulant, it is found that smaller particles(e.g. humic acid) move faster than larger particles(e.g. clay) in the fluid. Thus, in synthetic water composed by clay, HA and coagulant, HA collides and attaches to coagulant faster than clay. Once the coagulant surface is occupied by HA, its performance decreases because the occupied surface cannot attach to clay or nano-aggregate anymore.

Therefore, two-stage coagulant addition is expected to achieve the same particle removal rate with less coagulant. When using this addition method, coagulants are added to water stepwise before the fluid enters flocculator. It was assumed that after the first stage, all coagulant would be coated by humic acid. Therefore, in the first stage, coagulant was added to offset the effect of humic acid in water. Coagulant added in the second stage could function simply as an agglomerant that aggregate clay and nano-aggregate formed in the first stage to form big flocs.

Furthermore, if the coagulant dosage can be guided by a predictive model, operating conditions of flocculation process can be optimized, and coagulant can be used more efficiently. Since AguaClara is an engineering project team focuses on sustainable drinking water supply in developing regions, cost is a main concern. Therefore, using less amount of total coagulants in a two-stage settings is beneficial as it reduces the operational cost of water treatment plants. [(Liu et. al., 2011)](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/6847925/) With the same total coagulant, when partial amount was added half-way, it was found that two-stage, the separation of coagulant addition, can produce flocs 1.5 times the floc size comparing with one-stage, which potentially made two-stage more efficient than one-stage. As the floc blanket is formed, the flocs are connected together to form larger and more irregular structure, making two-stage addition more time and cost efficient than one-stage.

In this report, findings in literature review and previous work of the team are discussed. The experiment design and apparatus set-up used can also be found. Findings and conclusion based on experiment data and analysis are described at the end of the main body. Details in experimental operation such as ProCoDA setting, chemical dosage calculation, experiment process can be found after the main text.

## Literature Review and Previous Work

### Previous Work of AguaClara Project Team
The research of Yingda Du, a previous graduate student on the project team, studied the effects of NOM on flocculation. Her thesis determined the impact of humic acid on the particle size distribution of flocs and settled effluent turbidity of a synthetic surface water treated by polyaluminum chloride (PACl)[(Du, 2017)]( ). The results showed that presence of NOM increased the concentration of flocs and shifted the particle size distribution toward smaller particle sizes with a concurrent increase in the effluent turbidity. A mechanistically based hydraulic flocculation model, which took effects of humic acid into account, was developed in this research based on the observations of residual turbidity. The model was validated by successfully predicting data from independent experiments. The predictive model provided a useful guideline for effective coagulant dosages in water treatment.

Two-stage coagulant addition research was based on the study of bonding mechanism between different particles in water. There are three different kinds of particles in the research model: clay, humic acid, and coagulant nanoparticle. As it was shown in Figure 1, there are six kinds of the possible collision. However, only collisions with coagulant involved can occur in reality, because clay and humic acid are both negatively chargeed, they cannot attach to each other or themselves when a collision occurs.

 +In the last sentence, can't collisions happen between clay and humic acid, they just won't stick?

### Previous Work of Two-Stage Coagulant Addition Subteam
In Fall 2017 semester, the theoretical basis for future work was built by studying research report of previous particle removal research teams in AguaClara and relevant literature. The subteam made its apparatus based on the design of Contact Chamber subteam. Mechanisms related to the contact chambers can be found in the Contact Chamber subteam report[(Contact Chamber)](). Compared with the previous group, the set-up includes five pumps to achieve a precise control of fluid flow rate. Two down-flow contact chambers were applied in series before the fluid enters the flocculator. The contact chambers created a space for particle collision to take place. In our apparatus design, the main function contact chamber is providing a place for the collision between different particles, and distinguish the first stage from the second stage. The particle removal rate improvement in our research doesn't rely on the coagulant wall loss reduction, which described as the primary function of contact chamber in the Contact Chamber Group's report. The apparatus set-up of Spring 2018 semester was based on the previous design and the detail will be explained in later sections.

<div class="alert alert-block alert-danger">

 +So Yingda had a model for humic acid removal using flocculation? Does it also include clay or are they separate? In the next paragraph, you say that yours does include clay.
 ???
 Du: what do you mean? Isn't it clear yet?
</div>


**move this paragraph to experimental appartus design. repetitive info regarding ProCoDA operations**
Handling the operation of ProCoDA software was another critical task the subteam accomplished in Fall 2017 semester. ProCoDA is a process control software that allows the user to control many parts of the experimental apparatus and collect data automatically. ProCoDA can control the speed of peristaltic pumps, regulate flow through solenoid valves, and measure water quality parameters such as turbidity by connecting to the turbidimeter. Automated data acquisition can record the speed of pumps, the turbidity of water, the mass of container to an Excel spreadsheet directly. The experiment outcomes are processed with Excel and Python codes. Increment function is a command built in ProCoDA, and it can adjust experimental parameters automatically according to the setting over time. By applying the increment function, the team can conduct series of control experiments without staying in the lab. Python codes were created to calculate coagulant dosage, the composition of clay-HA mixture, and pump speed, the code was attached to the main text.

A floc blanket is a fluidized bed of flocs that are maintained in the bottom of an up-flow sedimentation tank. The highly concentrated suspension acts like the second flocculator that intercepts incoming clay particles and thus reduces the turbidity of the settled water.[(Weber-Shirk, 2009)](http://cuaguaclara.blogspot.com/2012/08/the-floc-blanket-quest.html) Floc blanket can improve the particle removal performance dramatically, one of AguaClara's goal was to add floc blanket in the plant. So the purpose of the research was to observe the floc blanket formation in every trial.

### Literature Review

Flocculation reduces the repulsive potential of electrical double layer of colloid by using coagulants. As a result, colloidal microparticles develop and then agglomerate into larger flocs. **(The mechanisms of agglomeration phenomenon are various, including the coagulant's metal ions into insoluble aggregates)**[(Henderson et al., 2006)](https://www.scopus.com/record/display.uri?eid=2-s2.0-33744489650&origin=inward&txGid=aaab348399699d2ac6549079332441da).

The optimum operating conditions to remove turbidity by flocculation, such as pH and coagulant dosages, are not necessarily the same for NOM removal.[(Yan et al., 2008)](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1383586609002342?via%3Dihub)
Thus the treatment processes for water contains the different concentration of NOM are varied.**(processing)**  Considering the high variability of NOM's organic components in different water sources, the removal mechanisms will substantially differ from one water source to the other or within the same source due to seasonal variations. The result will be a variable removal efficiency of coagulation and the formation of flocs with different sizes and structures, which urges the development of various water treatment strategies in different contexts[(Jarvis et al., 2006)](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0043135406002405?via%3Dihub).

The presence of NOM in water has notable effects in the dispersion of clay particles. The effect can be seen when using the particle-size distribution calculations on water with NOM present. [(PSD calculation)](https://www.innopharmalabs.com/tech/applications-and-processes/particle-size-distribution) A frequency increase in the nanoaggregate in comparison to a mixture with clay alone can be seen, because both humic acid and clay have negatively charged surfaces. However, the surface of humic acid is significantly more negative, thus creates repulsive forces between the particles, and increases the number of dispersed particles.[(Kretzschmar et. al)](https://dl.sciencesocieties.org/publications/sssaj/abstracts/61/1/SS0610010101) A direct relationship also exists between the decrease in pH and increase in sorption of humic acid.


Coagulants usually function as neutralizer and destabilizer in the particle removal process. Regarding NOM, the flocculation-based removal process is more efficient when more positively charged aluminum species are generated because NOM is mainly composed of organic compounds with negatively-charged functional groups. As shown in Figure 2, the negatively charged solids particles repel each other initially. However, as positively-charged coagulants are added to the mixture, they adhere to the negatively charged colloids, and neutralize the charge and destabilizing the particles. With the removal of charge, the destabilized colloids can now adhere to each other, forming microflocs.

![coagulant](https://github.com/AguaClara/2_stage_coag_addition/blob/master/image/coagulant.png)

    Figure 2： Coagulants function as neutralizer and destabilizer

Polyaluminum Chloride (PAC) was chosen to be the coagulants of the research, because of its compatibility with a majority of NOMs, low sensitivity to temperature and low residual metal-ion concentration. The effect of PAC in removing humic acid was significantly efficient comparing to other chemicals. [(Sudoh et. al., 2015)](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2213343715000871) Projects prefer using PAC also because of the economic factor(i.e. low cost and high availability in both solid and liquid form).

## Methods

### Experiment Process

#### Materials

* **Humic acid** -  the representative NOM. It is the most commonly found  NOM in the natural system.
* **Kaolin clay** - represents the colloidal solids.
* **Polyaluminium chloride (PAC)** - the coagulant.

#### Variables

##### Control Variables
* **Influent Turbidity** - the influent turbidity value TSCA team evaluated was 100 NTU.
* **Coagulant Dosages** - the increment function used in ProCoDA increased the coagulant dosages stepwise. When the run time of current state reaches the duration set in ProCoDA, the function will be activated and increase the coagulant pump speed according to the setting. Details about ProCoDA set-up can be found after the main text.

<div class="alert alert-block alert-danger">
Consider "Doses" rather than "Dosages"
</div>

##### Independent Variables
* **Concentration of Humic Acid**
* **Concentration of Kaolin Clay**

##### Dependent Variables
* **Effluent Turbidity** - the effluent turbidity showed the efficiency of particle removal in the system.

Throughout the semester, a series of one-stage coagulant addition experiments was carried out to find the optimal coagulant dosage that could reduce the effluent turbidity of 3 NTU or less, the required turbidity for the AguaClara's filter system. During one-stage experiments, the second coagulant pump was turned off so that only one stream of coagulant is added.

In two-stage coagulant addition experiments, each dosage of coagulant used in one-stage addition experiment was divided into two parts by adding one more stream of coagulant between the first and second contact chamber. The goal of two-stage experiment was to find the optimal distribution between the first and second stream coagulant. The desirable situation was that most of the coagulant from the first addition would offset the effect humic acid in the water, and coagulant from the second addition would be able to attach to clay and nanoaggregate, thus forming big flocs and reducing the effluent turbidity effectively.

**A T-connection as shown in Figure 3 was installed between the two coagulant pumps to help manage the amount of coagulant that was input into the system. The first pump controlled the total amount of coagulant being put into the system through the left branch to the right branch. When the second coagulant pump was opened, it controlled how much coagulant is used for the second dosage, draining directly from the left branch to the top branch. The T connection is a fundamental set-up for two stage coagulant addition. Coagulant flowed in through the left branch and was separated into two streams by the top and right branch.**

**Must give a minimum exact number of runs that would give a sufficient amount of data**

### Experimental Apparatus Design
ProCoDA (Process Control and Data Acquisition) software was used to automate data collection and control the experimental apparatus. Two up-flow contact chambers were set before the fluid entered the flocculator, so that the coagulants were allowed more time and space to collide with particles in water. During the first stage of addition, in the first contact chamber, coagulants collided and they were covered by humic acid. In the primary stages of setting up the apparatus, the pump was designed to input the correct coagulant dosage before each contact chamber, allowing for two-stage coagulant addition to take place. However, due to the limitations of ProCoDA, we could only control a maximum of two pumps at the same time. The second coagulant pump had to be controlled manually.

The general apparatus set-up developed from last semester was kept throughout this semester as shown in Figure 4 and 5. The contact chamber was reversed from down-flow to up-flow so that all the air in the system can be pushed out. Due to the limited space on our bench area, we had to make simplifications in our apparatus set-up. Nevertheless, the simplifications reflect the nature of the AguaClara water treatment plant. The sedimentation tube in our system had the fundamental structures of what would be presented in an AguaClara water treatment plant, including the floc weir, floc settler, floc blanket and sludge valve. Further detail about the design of sedimentation tube can be referred to the research of High Rate Sedimentation group in AguaClara. A tube flocculator was used in this research because it could be idealized as a high-Péclet-number reactor much like a baffled hydraulic flocculator, and also because the average velocity gradient in laminar tube flow was well defined [(Weber-Shirk and Lion 2010)](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0043135410004136). An electronic balance had also been implemented, which was connected to the ProCoDA system to track the mass change of coagulant over time. The balance would be able to verify the amount of coagulant entered the system that was actually reflected on data collected by ProCoDA.

    Figure 5: Current Apparatus Set-up

ProCoDA can only control a maximum of two pumps due to the limit port. The clay pump must be connected to the computer to achieve closed-loop control, and one of the coagulant pumps had to be controlled by ProCoDA to apply increment function. Therefore, the  humic acid and clay mixture must be controlled manually. In the experiment, clay, HA, and water were added, according to the calculated amount, into a 10 L stock tank with a stirrer. The calculated amounts can be determined from the Python code later in the report. This stock tank was connected to the clay pump. The clay pump speed was controlled by ProCoDA to maintain a relatively fixed influent turbidity. After that, a mixture of humic acid and clay went through the first turbidimeter, and influent turbidity of the raw water was measured. Subsequently, the first stream of coagulant was added right before the fluid entered the first contact chamber. However for a two stage coagulant addition experiment, the second stream of coagulant was pumped into the system after the first contact chamber.

### Experiment Operation
The two-stage coagulant addition experiment was heavily based on the data generated in one stage addition experiment. The total coagulant dosage used for two-stage coagulant addition was the optimal amount found in the one-stage addition experiments. Two additional dosages of coagulant were added for comparison by varying +/-0.5 mg/L of the optimal dosage based on the first-stage results.

For one-stage addition experiments, the coagulant dosages usually ranged from 1.0 to 3.0 mg/L in every circulation of the increment function. The dosage was increased several times by increasing the coagulant pump speed under the control of ProCoDA. The target influent turbidity was kept at 100 NTU by ProCoDA and the humic acid concentration was constant throughout each trial, it can be varied to study the impact of HA. It was found that the desirable effluent turbidity and floc blanket (Fig. 6) was usually generated around 1.5 mg/L of coagulant concentration. In the previous semester experiments, 0.5mg/L and 1mg/L coagulant were insufficient to reduce the turbidity of synthetic water efficiently. By applying different humic acid concentration between separate trials with same coagulant dosage, the effect of humic acid on flocculation process was tested.

In the beginning of the semester, HA concentration of 0.8mg/L was used, but there was no floc blanket formation in a majority of trials. The humic acid concentration used in the experiment was then decreased to guarantee the formation of floc blanket in every trial. Clay synthetic water without humic acid was used in research to compare with HA and clay synthetic water, such that the effect of humic acid on the distance between clay particles could be studied. The decision to reduce the HA concentration was based on the interactions between clay and humic acid, which can be revisited in the literature review. A series of experiments for two-stage addition were conducted to find the most effective ratio of coagulant allocation between the first and second stage. In the future, after generating enough data, the overall particle removal efficiency of one-stage and two-stage addition would be compared.

Furthermore, the coagulant pump in the system performed poorly when operating around its lower bound of speed. According to the past experiments, pump speed lower than 12 RPM was inadequate and should be avoided. The lowest pump speed can be set by adjusting the increment function, as the intercept of the function defined the lowest coagulant pump speed. Therefore, for later experiments, a higher intercept for the increment function was set so that the lowest pump speed was 20 RPM.

## Results and Analysis
### Analysis of Undesirable Research Outcome

Experiment data of one stage addition experiments at the beginning did not align with the expectation. The floc blanket was expected to be found in the sedimentation tank in every trials because the minimum coagulant dosage in experiment was 1.5 mg/L, which was enough to reduce the effluent turbidity to 15 NTU or less according to past research. Experiment data with and without the formation of floc blanket could not be compared with each other. Besides, the goal of the flocculation and sedimentation system was reducing the water turbidity to 5 NTU or less to meet the requirement of AguaClara filtration system, which was unable to treat water with 5 NTU or higher turbidity.

One possible explanation was that due to the limit time of data acquisition state (detailed explanation of ProCoDA set points can be found after the main text), the system did not have enough time to form the floc blanket. Therefore, the duration of data acquisition state was extended, from 3600 seconds to 4800 seconds, and to 8000 seconds. Based on observation, dense floc blanket as shown in Figure 6 was formed one hour after the coagulant was added. It was found that if no floc blanket formed within two hours in a trial, the floc would stay the same, and no floc blanket can be observed even at a later time.

    Figure 6: Floc blanket in the sedimentation tube

The experiment data of one stage addition also did not exactly aligned with the floc model. By using the same HA concentration and coagulant dosage, the effluent turbiditiy was higher than the model result. After studying the experiment settings of past research and other subteams, this research team was found to be the only one premixed the clay and HA to create the synthetic water. Based on this observation, it was possible that the mechanism of particle distance and surface charge had impacted the results.

![datalog](https://github.com/AguaClara/2_stage_coag_addition/blob/master/image/100NTU.png)

    Figure 7: Floc Model result at 100NTU

### Impact of surface charge
Since the clay and humic acid had to be mixed before pumping into the water, this could lead to two possible outcomes. If clay was covered by humic acid when mixed in the stock tank, there might be a suspension that was easier to remove as the amount of humic acid was reduced. However, according to observation, suspension with humic acid was harder to be removed than pure clay suspension. Therefore, a second hypothesis was suggested. As both clay and humic acid are negatively charged, while humic acid has a higher charge density, due the prior mixing, the charge density of clay particles increased after attached by humic acid and the clay particle had become more repulsive to each other. Thus, the clay suspension was more dispersed, and the surface area of clay was increased, which caused the suspension harder to be removed by flocculation. According to observations, suspension with humic acid required more coagulant to be removed than suspension with only clay.

Two different trials with different humic acid concentration were compared in Figure 8, and parameters other than HA were all kept the same. As shown in the graph, when there was humic acid in the suspension, the effluent turbidity went down, and reached a steady level at a slower rate. The floc blanket was also formed at a slower rate, and the lowest effluent turbidity was higher than suspension without HA. These observation suggested the premixing of HA and clay led to a decrease in particle removal efficiency.

### Impact of coagulant dosage
Regarding the effect of coagulants dosage, determining the optimal amount was crucial. Overdosing the coagulant could result in a substantial increase in the amount of generated sludge and a decrease in pH, while a lower dose could be the cause for the residual metal remaining in treated water[(Ibrahim and Aziz, 2014)](http://www.ijsrpub.com/uploads/papers/IJSRES/IJSRES-2014/Mar/IJSRES-13-111.pdf). Increasing the PACl dose had been shown to increase NOM removal up to a certain point. However, NOM removal was not significantly improved with very high alum dosages, which suggested that some components of NOM were recalcitrant to being removed by coagulant.

Table 3: Experimental Parameter for Figure 9

| Parameter | Value |
| --------- | ----- |

| Humic Acid Concentration | 8mg/L |
| Target Influent Turbidity|  100NTU  |
| Up Flow Velocity| 2mm/s|





Under the control of increment function, coagulant dosage was increased over time. Figure 9 shows the experiment data of one stage addition trial, which could be used to study the effect of coagulant dosage on floc formation. The influent turbidity was 100NTU, and the effluent turbidity reached the peak during the flush state, when floc blanket was washed out. Then, it was reduced steadily after the system switched back to data acquisition state, the floc blanket formed after coagulant entered the system (detail explanation can be found after the main text). As shown in Figure 8, with the stepwise increase of coagulant dosage, the effluent turbidity dropped faster with a steeper slope. This suggested that the floc blanket formed faster with higher coagulant dosage, which aligned with the observation.

### Analysis of One Stage Coagulant addition procedure

<div class="alert alert-block alert-danger">
Capitalize header
</div>

A primary concern was the lack of consistency in the formation of a floc blanket in our Sedtank during 1 Stage coagulant addition. It was concluded that due the limitations of ProCoDA, it constrained our team to mix clay and humic acid before it enters into the system. We hypothesis that due the prior mixing, ~~the humic acid makes the surfaces of the clay more negatively charged.~~ This disperses the clay particles more thus creating more clay particle surface area. This means that there is more clay than there is coagulant available to bind together and create flocs.~~In order to determine whether this hypothesis is true, we have modified our calculations and ratio of humic acid.~~

<div class="alert alert-block alert-danger">
This section is hard to understand with the cross-outs seems unfinished.

</div>

## Conclusions

A set of control experiments with fixed turbidity and different coagulant dosage was carried out with the increment function of ProCoDA. In general, it was deduced that with the current design of system, when the turbidity of water entering the system was relatively low, more coagulant was needed to reach the target effluent turbidity. The target effluent turbidity of this experiment was no more than 3 NTU, in order to comply with the standard AguaClara system.

Removal from 100 to 3 is hard to achieve. Make sure that you justify the use of 100 NTU as a starting point in the method section.

It was found that two-stage coagulant addition needed more time than one stage addition to form floc blanket. However, in trials with relatively low turbidity, the formation of floc blanket was not seen under the same condition when comparing one-stage and two-stage. No significant difference was observed in terms of the lowest turbidity between one stage and two stage addition experiment under the same parameters.

In the rest semester, both one stage and two stage experiments would be continued. If the hypothesis of 2-stage hypothesis was validated, a model could be created to guide the amount of coagulant dosage in water treatment plant, and potentially lessen the coagulant used, which could cut down the operational cost.

## Future Work
The current apparatus design is shown deficient by the contact chamber group because the two up-flow contact chambers applied could not function as what they were designed to be. Experiments demonstrated that the current design of contact chamber could not successfully reduce the wall loss of the coagulant or improve the particle removal efficiency. Although currently the contact chamber only acted as a place for particle collision, and for defining the first and second stage addition physically, modifying the design of contact chamber in the future could potentially increase particle removal efficiency. Currently, AguaClara uses a tube contact chamber, which can be easily fabricated by cutting a PVC tube. Without changing the design, the effect of contact chamber with different length and diameter can be studied.

The effect of pH has not been considered in the current research. However, pH could be the single most crucial factor affecting the effectiveness of metal-based coagulants[(Qin et al., 2006)](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1383586605003187?via%3Dihub). In the future, pH can be measured during the experiment by both pH meter and pH test paper. In either water treatment plant or apparatus in the lab, pH can be adjusted by applying different chemical reagent, and varying pH will allow us to see the effect of pH. On the other hand, experimental process can simulate the environment of water treatment plant if the pH value align with the water is kept constant in the plant.

<div class="alert alert-block alert-danger">
This belongs in the results/analysis and measuring pH should just be mentioned here as an add-on to the apparatus.

Do you think pH has affected your results?

Du: PH is not a minor issue in this kind of particle removal research, it can impact the removal efficiency a lot.

The predictive floc model developed by AguaClara is based on the past apparatus set-up and experiment process. Without considering the presence of floc blanket and the use of new tube sedimentation tank, the model cannot simulate the current experiment, and its modeling result deviates significantly from present experimental data. The ultimate goal is to revise the model to align it with the experiment in the lab well so that the up-to-date research findings provide a guide for AguaClara water treatment plant.

The research on two-stage coagulant addition should continue in the future. According to our study, the two-stage addition was proved to perform better than one-stage addition in some circumstance. Two-stage addition can achieve higher particle removal rate than one-stage while using the same amount of coagulant. Future research group should test the performance of two-stage addition in a condition closer to the real world to guide the application of this technology in AguaClara water treatment plants.

# Experiment Manual

## Fabrication Details
Most of the fabiracation of bench area apparatus was completed in last semester, the connection between different part is described in the experiment apparatus part. The fabrication of contact chamber can refered to the report of contact chamber group.[Contact Chamber]()


## Experimental Methods

### Experiment
**Step 1.** Fill stock tanks. One stock tank should be filled with a diluted solution of PAC coagulant, and the other should have a mixture of water, clay, and humic acid. The concentration of solution depends on experiment objectives and can be calculated by using the chemical dosage calculation code below.

**Step 2.** Once the solution is prepared, open the water and wastewater valves, turn on turbidimeters, and let the apparatus completely filled with water, the experiment is now ready to run. Be sure to turn on the sludge pump, a 1L/s pump next to the effluent turbidimeter, to ensure that sludge is drained to the wastewater line.



**Step 3.** Check important set points in ProCoDA. Set target influent turbidity, duration of data acquisition state and flushing state.

**Step 4.** Open the ProCoDA software and turn the "operation state" from OFF to ON, to turn on the clay pump so the influent turbidimeter will soon reach the target influent turbidity. Once the influent turbidity fluctuates around the target influent turbidity, go back to ProCoDA and switch the state from "ON" to "Data acquisition state", the coagulant pump will be turned on. Then switch the operational mode from "Manual" to "Auto Switch".

**Step 5.** The data acquisition state will go back and forth with the flush state, which is used to wash out the floc blanket. The data will be recorded on a spreadsheet for further use.


**Step 6.** Once the data collected, check the catalog and turn off ProCoDA. Proceed to the cleaning procedure when experimentation is finished.

### Cleaning Procedure
 Once the experiment is done, we want to completely wash out the apparatus so it will be ready for the next experiment.

 **Step 1.** Turn off the clay and coagulant pumps while running the water pump with a relatively high speed, normally over 120rpm.



 **Step 2.** Remove entire apparatus from the wall (recirculator \& tube settler) and thoroughly wash it out, then reattach it back to the wall.

 **Step 3.** Wash out the flocculator by unplugging the connection between the outflow tube from the influent turbidimeter and the flocculator, and plug-in tubing from the nearby sink to wash out the flocculator. Make sure there is a bucket at the end of the flocculator that will collect the water.

 **Step 4.** Clean the influent and effluent turbidimeter. Make sure to turn on the Bypass channel first! First, open the bypass valve. Second, pinch the black outflow tube.

 **Step 5.** Remove and wash out the vials from both turbidimeters. Refill the vials with clean water, then put back into the turbidimeters. Use Kimtech wipes to clean the glass thoroughly.

 **Step 6.** Turn off water to the flocculator and detach the tubing. Hook up the influent turbidimeter back into flocculator then re-open the influent turbidimeter but keep the effluent turbidimeter closed. Turn on the water pump to clean out the influent turbidimeter as well as the flocculator.

 **Step 7.** Pour out the coagulant reservoir into a different bucket and rinse reservoir with deionized water to make sure all residue is washed out. Take out the push pin then wash out the coagulant reservoir thoroughly. Replenish reservoir with 5L (or less) of deionized water. Use Python calculation codes to determine how much 70.9mg/L PACl coagulant needed to use to get the desired results of the experiment.

## Experimental Checklist
Before running the experiment, check apparatus with following steps:

**Step 1.** Turn on the influent and effluent turbidimeter and check whether the inside glass container is clean.

**Step 2.** Before reassembling the turbidimeter again, we let only the tap water run through the system to see if there is any leak, especially near the turbidimeter, in case water would flow to the interior of the meter and cause damage to the apparatus.

**Step 3.** Turn on all pumps and set them with a tiny RPM value, then check if pumps run in the right direction.

**Step 4.** Go to the "edit rules" part of the ProCoDA, check the slope and intercept value of the increment function, make sure to set those values according to the calculation.


**Step 5.** The last step, turn to "operation" part of ProCoDA, switch the state to "Data Acquisition" and make sure states would switch between one another automatically.

## ProCoDA Method File

### States

**{OFF}** - Resting state of ProCoDA. All sensors, relays, and pumps are turned off.

**{ON}** - ON state of ProCoDA. All sensors, relays, and pumps are turned on.

**{Data Acquisition}** - State where the coagulant pumps work and the increment function would increase its value each time when system switches to this state. The duration of this state usually set to be 2 hours, which is enough for the floc blanket to form.


**{Flush}** - State where the coagulant pumps stop working, during this stage raw water would run through the system and flush out the floc blanket build in last data acquisition state so that every data acquisition state would run with same original system condition.


### Set Points

**{Turb target}** - The value of our target influent turbidity, ProCoDA will control the clay pump to maintain the target influent turbidity.

**{pump control(clay)}** - Use this set point to decide which pump should we control.

**{Flush Time}** - Duration of the flush state.

**{Data Acquisition Time}** - Duration of the data acquisition state.

**{State to Increment}** - Tells the increment function when to increase its value, in this experiment, increment function controlled coagulant pump speed.

**{Slope}** - The slope of increment function.

**{Intercept}** - The intercept of increment function.

**{Max x}** - Times the increment function will work during one circulation.


**{coagulant pump control}** - Points out which coagulant pump should we control.


**{coagulant pump property}** - Flow rate per revolution.

**{balance}** - Variable with the value returned by the electrical balance.
