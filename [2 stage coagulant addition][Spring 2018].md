## Abstract
previous work: Last semester, our group designed and fabricated the experiment apparatus and conducted experiment for both 1 stage and 2 stages coagulant addition. Our data it not enough to come up with a grand conclusion, but the data we generated suggest that there might be trade-off when we switch from 1 stage to 2 stages. Besides, we also made some simplification to our system.
goals & objectives: This semseter, we will try to close the debate of 1 stage vs 2 stage, come up with a conclusion and generate enough data to support it.
what you have accomplished: Up to now we have completed the literature review, and working on apparatus set up.
and future work: We have encountered several problem: the high pressure within the system, leak caused by the poor conection. In next few weeks, we would fix those problem and begin to conduct our experiment.

## Introduction
Explain how the completion of your challenge will affect AguaClara and the mission of providing safe drinking water (or sustainable wastewater treatment!). If this is a continuing team, how will your contribution build upon previous research? What needs to be further discovered or defined? If this is a new team, what prompted the inclusion of this team?

## Literature Review and Previous Work
Discuss what is already known about your research area based on both external work and that of past AguaClara Teams. Connect your objectives with what is already known and explain what additional contribution you intend to make. Make sure to add APA formatted in-text citations. If you mention the author(s) in your sentence, you can simply give the year of publication.[(Logan et. al. 1987)](http://www.jstor.org/stable/pdf/25043431.pdf?acceptTC=true)

The fundamental objective of the two stage coagulant addition subteam is to research and find out if there are beneficial effects of two stage addition of PaCl. Besides lab research, this requires research from external parties and other AguaClara teams. We investigated the effects of humic Acid in water and how it coagulates, as well as revisiting Yingda Du’s thesis on the 
effects of humic Acid on flocculation. With this background knowledge, this would aid our advancement in our research.

Observations and a Geometric Explanation of the Effects of Humic Acid on Flocculation
 The general science behind flocculation can be understood by analysing the thesis of the observations and a geometric explanation of the effects of HA flocculation by Yingda Du. The thesis gives a clear layout of why we are using HA as the natural organic matter as well as the chemistry behind the creation of flocs. We are using HA as the exemplary compound to represent dissolved NOM because it is the most commonly found form of NOM in our surroundings.  Clay is used to represent the colloidal solids. As NOM is easily found in our soil and water, it increases our need of coagulant to promote flocculation of dissolved particles in water.  Hence why in our model of the experiment we add humic acid and clay with the coagulant PaCl (polyaluminium chloride). However, there is a cut-off point as to how much coagulant we can add to the raw water for it to be beneficial in the removal of NOM. This observation shows that some NOM become increasingly uncooperative to being removed due to the increased presence of coagulant. 

Using PACl as neutralizer and coagulant aid
	Polyaluminum Chloride (PAC) is often associated with this process to reduce DBPs precursors. PAC prepolymerized coagulants are highly preferred commercially because of its wide range of targets, such as low dosage, wide pH range, low sensitivity of temperature and low residual meal-ion concentration. Therefore, in the study, researchers investigate the removal of HA using PAC with CaCO3 as neutralizer and coagulant aid. The water sampled is from Sebangu River, Indonesia, which has a dissolved organic carbon content of 33.4mg/L.
The effect of PAC with Calcium Carbonate in removing Humic Acid was significantly efficient comparing to other chemicals, because such combination acts as both alkaline chemical and coagulant agent. Comparing with other coagulant types such as Ferric Acid and Aluminum Sulfate, PAC has a significantly high removal efficiency even at a low dosage. In addition, the removal rate of PAC is higher than that of NaOH as alkaline agent. CaCO3 as coagulant reagent, has a significantly high sedimentation velocity, and the sludge volume is reduced by half comparing to that of NaOH. CaCO3 has the highest rate of removing HA at 96.6% and 91.6 % for DOC, as its flock core promoted flock formation. This allowed a shorter settling time for the removal for DOC. In addition, the electrical double layer (EDL) of both PAC surface and HA colloid particles is compressed by Ca2+ ions.



## Methods
Explain the techniques you have used to acquire additional data and insights. Reserve fine detail for the Manual at the end of the report, but use this section to give an overview with enough detail for the reader to understand your Results and Analysis. Describe your apparatus, and have a justification for every decision you made and every parameter you chose in the design of the apparatus. Be especially careful to detail the conditions your experiments were conducted under, as this information is especially important for interpreting your results

Below, some example sections are given. Sectioning the report is meant to keep similar information together.  Continue making sections as necessary, or delete sections if you do not need them. Feel free to add subsubsections to further delineate the information. For example, under the Experimental Apparatus section below, the EStaRS team might consider having sections such as "Filter Design" and "Filter Fabrication".

### Experimental Apparatus
Explain your apparatus setup using enough detail such that future teams can recreate your apparatus. Make sure to explain why you built it this way.
* Design (calculations, constraints)

  $\frac{-b\pm\sqrt{b^2-4ac}}{2a}$
* Schematic (label parts)

  <img src="https://github.com/jillianwhiting/Jillian-Whiting/blob/master/Images/IMG_0009.jpg?raw=true" height=250 width=200>

* Image (from lab; label parts)
* Materials (dimensions, materials)
* Complications in construction
* If already constructed: write a brief summary of important constraints, include any revisions to apparatus, also reference the prior report where construction is described

### Procedure
Discuss your experimental procedure. How did you run your experiment? What were you testing? What were the values of relevant parameters?

## Results and Analysis
Present an observation (results), then explain what happened (analysis).  Each paragraph should focus on one aspect of your results. In that same paragraph, you should interpret that result.  
In other words, there should not be two distinct paragraphs, but instead one paragraph containing one result and the interpretation and analysis of this result. Here are some guiding questions for results and analysis:

When describing your results, present your data, using the guidelines below:
* What happened? What did you find?
* Show your experimental data in a professional way.
```python
from aide_design.play import*
x = np.array([1,2,3,4,5])
y = np.array([1,2,3,4,5])
plt.figure('ax',(10,8))
plt.plot(x,y,'*')
plt.savefig('/Users/jillianwhiting/github/Jillian-Whiting/Images/linear')
plt.show()
```
![linear](https://github.com/jillianwhiting/Jillian-Whiting/blob/master/Images/linear.png?raw=true)
Figure 1: Captions are very important for figures. Captions go below figures.

After describing a particular result, within a paragraph, go on to connect your work to fundamental physics/chemistry/statics/fluid mechanics, or whatever field is appropriate. Analyze your results and compare with theoretical expectations; or, if you have not yet done the experiments, describe your expectations based on established knowledge. Include implications of your results. How will your results influence the design of AguaClara plants? If possible provide clear recommendations for design changes that should be adopted. Show your experimental data in a professional way using the following guidelines:
* Why did you get those results/data?
* Did these results line up with expectations?
* What went wrong?
* If the data do not support your hypothesis, is there another hypothesis that describes your new data?

## Conclusions
Explain what you have learned and how that influences your next steps. Why does what you discovered matter to AguaClara?

Make sure that you defend your conclusions with facts and results.

## Future Work
Describe your plan of action for the next several weeks of research. Detail the next steps for this team. How can AguaClara use what you discovered for future projects? Your suggestions for challenges for future teams are most welcome. Should research in this area continue?

# Manual
The goal of this section is to provide all of the guidance that would be necessary for a future team to pick up your work where you left off. Please try to be thorough and put yourselves in the shoes of a newcomer to the project. Below are some recommended sections, but the manual will likely take a slightly different form for each team.

## Fabrication Details
Include any information related to the fabrication of equipment, experimental apparatuses, or technologies. Include the purpose of each step and the fabrication methods used. Reference appropriate safety precautions.

## Special Components
If your subteam uses a particular part that is unique and you could foresee a future subteam needing to order it or learn more about it, please include basic information like the vendor where it was purchased, catalog/item number, and a link to any documentation.

## Experimental Methods
### Set-up
Step 1.
* Put tasks in a sequential order.
* It is okay to have sub-lists.

## Experimental Checklist
Another potential section could include a list of things that you need to check before running an experiment.

## ProCoDA Method File
Use this section to explain your method file. This could be broken up into several components as shown below:

### States
Here, you should describe the function of each state in your method file, both in terms of its overall purpose and also in terms of the details that make it distinct from other states. For example:
\begin{itemize}
\item \underline{OFF} - Resting state of ProCoDA. All sensors, relays, and pumps are turned off.

\item \underline{OFF} - Resting state of ProCoDA. All sensors, relays, and pumps are turned off.
\item \underline{ON} - ON state of ProCoDa. All sensors, relays, and pumps are turned on.
\item \underline{Data Acquisition} - State 3 of the experimental process where the coagulant pump is working and the increment function would increase its value each time when we switch to this state. The data acquisition state usually set to be 2 hours, which is enough for the floc blanket to form.
\end{itemize}
### Set Points
Here, you should list the set points used in your method file and explain their use as well as how each was calculated.
