## Abstract
**Previous work:** Last semester, our group designed and fabricated the experiment apparatus and conducted experiment for both 1 stage and 2 stages coagulant addition. Our data is not enough to come up with a grand conclusion, but the data we generated suggest that there might be trade-off when we switch from 1 stage to 2 stages. Besides, we also made some simplification to our system.


**Goals & Objectives:** This semester, our group focused on comparing 1 stage addition with 2 stage addition and carrying on the experiment with different influent turbidities, coagulant dosage and humic acid concentration as well as trying to improve Yingda's coagulant dosage model. Besides, more insight on the particles bond mechanism, flocculation, and geometry of the contact chambers were needed. Eventually, we will try to close the debate of 1 stage vs 2 stage, come up with a conclusion and generate enough data to support it.


**What we have accomplished:** Up to now we have completed the literature review, and working on apparatus set up.The research was  based on Yingda's thesis, who studied the effect of humic acid on the coagulant dosing model. Based on the bonding mechanism, it could be hypothesized that two-stage coagulant addition would increase the removal efficiency of particles while maintaining the coagulant dosage.


**Future work:** We have encountered several problems: the high pressure within the system, the leak caused by the poor connection. In next few weeks, we would fix those problems and begin to conduct our experiment. After discussed with Monroe, we suspected that the size of our first contact chamber is not enough for the HA and coag nanoparticles in the synthetic water to generate enough successful collision, so recalculation and test on the CC are also required.




## Introduction

We have to understand the physical and chemical process in flocculation before we can optimize our water treatment process, thus a predictive model which can describe the flocculation process is needed. However, in the past research of AguaClara project team, the model we built only consider the clay and coagulant in the system, it is kind of useless in engineering applications because NOM can be found in nearly every surface water resources and some of the groundwater resources and the presence of NOM can create a need for increased coagulant doses in drinking water treatment.

So we have to extend the model base on our past research, take the effect of NOM on flocculation into consideration. After study the bond mechanism between clay, humic acid, and coagulant, we came up with an assumption that we could add the coagulant separately to save coagulant, because it was assumed that after stage 1, all coagulant would be coated by humic acid, thus the coagulant adds in stage 2 could merely function as an agglomerant then achieved better performance in flocculation process and the aggregation process. After we have the model, we can try to optimize our water treatment process, for example, use the coagulant more efficiently and cut down the operational cost. AguaClara is an engineering project team, so cost is always our concern.


## Literature Review and Previous Work

The fundamental objective of the two stage coagulant addition subteam is to research and find out if there are beneficial effects of two stage addition of PaCl. This would theoretically allow us to use our coagulant more efficiently which would consequently also reduce cost. Besides lab research, this requires research from external parties and other AguaClara teams. We investigated the effects of humic Acid in water and how it coagulates, as well as revisiting Yingda Du’s thesis on the effects of humic acid on flocculation. With this background knowledge, this would aid our advancement in our research.

Humic acid is considered natural organic matter, and it is of the final components made after the breakdown of plant and animal decay. It is commonly found in the soil as it promotes a fertility, it is also used as fertilizers. There is an increase in humic acid concentrations in the wet seasons. The most visual issue of humic acid is that it cause water to change colour. However, in the process of creating potable water, the addition of other compounds and elements with humic acid assists the formation of harmful byproducts such as trihalomethane and haloacetic acid.

### Observations and a Geometric Explanation of the Effects of Humic Acid on Flocculation
  The general science behind flocculation can be understood by analysing the thesis of the observations and a geometric explanation of the effects of HA flocculation by Yingda Du. The thesis gives a clear layout of why we are using HA as the natural organic matter as well as the chemistry behind the creation of flocs. We are using HA as the exemplary compound to represent dissolved NOM because it is the most commonly found form of NOM in our surroundings.  Clay is used to represent the colloidal solids. As NOM is easily found in our soil and water, it increases our need of coagulant to promote flocculation of dissolved particles in water.  Hence why in our model of the experiment we add humic acid and clay with the coagulant PaCl (polyaluminium chloride). However, there is a cut-off point as to how much coagulant we can add to the raw water for it to be beneficial in the removal of NOM. This observation shows that some NOM become increasingly uncooperative to being removed due to the increased presence of coagulant. Our understanding behind the lack of floc formation of NOM in the presence of increased coagulant addition is limited, yet it is an area of interest in determining the magnitude of the effect.
Nevertheless, Yingda’s report focuses on the effect on coagulation of humic acid in the form of hydraulic flocculation, with the consideration of the following processes of filtration and sedimentation. Her research is crucial to our subteam as it provides us with a basis of how we should set up our own apparatus, as well as the physics behind the creation of flocs.

### Using PACl as neutralizer and coagulant aid
Coagulation is one of the most effective methods to remove fine substances from particles. Polyaluminum Chloride (PAC) is often associated with this process to reduce DBPs precursors. PAC prepolymerized coagulants are highly preferred commercially because of its wide range of targets, such as low dosage, wide pH range, low sensitivity of temperature and low residual meal-ion concentration. The effect of PAC with Calcium Carbonate in removing Humic Acid was significantly efficient comparing to other chemicals, because such combination acts as both alkaline chemical and coagulant agent. Comparing with other coagulant types such as Ferric Acid and Aluminum Sulfate, PAC has a significantly high removal efficiency even at a low dosage. In addition, the removal rate of PAC is higher than that of NaOH as alkaline agent. CaCO3 as coagulant reagent, has a significantly high sedimentation velocity, and the sludge volume is reduced by half comparing to that of NaOH. CaCO3 has the highest rate of removing HA and DOC, as its flock core promoted flock formation. This allowed a shorter settling time for the removal for DOC. In addition, the electrical double layer (EDL) of both PAC surface and HA colloid particles is compressed by Ca2+ ions.

## Methods
Explain the techniques you have used to acquire additional data and insights. Reserve fine detail for the Manual at the end of the report, but use this section to give an overview with enough detail for the reader to understand your Results and Analysis. Describe your apparatus, and have a justification for every decision you made and every parameter you chose in the design of the apparatus. Be especially careful to detail the conditions your experiments were conducted under, as this information is especially important for interpreting your results

Below, some example sections are given. Sectioning the report is meant to keep similar information together.  Continue making sections as necessary, or delete sections if you do not need them. Feel free to add subsubsections to further delineate the information. For example, under the Experimental Apparatus section below, the EStaRS team might consider having sections such as "Filter Design" and "Filter Fabrication".

### Procedure
Discuss your experimental procedure. How did you run your experiment? What were you testing? What were the values of relevant parameters?

## Results and Analysis
Present an observation (results), then explain what happened (analysis).  Each paragraph should focus on one aspect of your results. In that same paragraph, you should interpret that result.  
In other words, there should not be two distinct paragraphs, but instead one paragraph containing one result and the interpretation and analysis of this result. Here are some guiding questions for results and analysis:

When describing your results, present your data, using the guidelines below:
* What happened? What did you find?
* Show your experimental data in a professional way.
```python
from aide_design.play import*
x = np.array([1,2,3,4,5])
y = np.array([1,2,3,4,5])
plt.figure('ax',(10,8))
plt.plot(x,y,'*')
plt.savefig('/Users/jillianwhiting/github/Jillian-Whiting/Images/linear')
plt.show()
```

Figure 1: Captions are very important for figures. Captions go below figures.

After describing a particular result, within a paragraph, go on to connect your work to fundamental physics/chemistry/statics/fluid mechanics, or whatever field is appropriate. Analyze your results and compare with theoretical expectations; or, if you have not yet done the experiments, describe your expectations based on established knowledge. Include implications of your results. How will your results influence the design of AguaClara plants? If possible provide clear recommendations for design changes that should be adopted. Show your experimental data in a professional way using the following guidelines:
* Why did you get those results/data?
* Did these results line up with expectations?
* What went wrong?
* If the data do not support your hypothesis, is there another hypothesis that describes your new data?

## ProCoDA Method File
Use this section to explain your method file. This could be broken up into several components as shown below:

### States
Here, you should describe the function of each state in your method file, both in terms of its overall purpose and also in terms of the details that make it distinct from other states. For example:
\begin{itemize}
\item \underline{OFF} - Resting state of ProCoDA. All sensors, relays, and pumps are turned off.

\item \underline{OFF} - Resting state of ProCoDA. All sensors, relays, and pumps are turned off.
\item \underline{ON} - ON state of ProCoDa. All sensors, relays, and pumps are turned on.
\item \underline{Data Acquisition} - State 3 of the experimental process where the coagulant pump is working and the increment function would increase its value each time when we switch to this state. The data acquisition state usually set to be 2 hours, which is enough for the floc blanket to form.
